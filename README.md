<h2>InternShips:</h2>

<h3>Anselm Inc. (2023)</h3>

During the August of 2023, I had an internship at Anselm Inc. with a classmate for two weeks. 
We worked on cyber security certificates from Forescout Technology.
For the first week, we took lectures about cyber security from our manager to gain basic understanding of the topic.
After then, we took online courses from Forescout to learn and understand their cyber security product.
By the end of the second week, I completed the Forescout's online exam and recieved a engineer certificate and sales certificate.

<h3>URC Australia 2024 (2024)</h3>

Me and my classmate competed in the Universal Robotics Competition hosted in Australia in late 2024. 
We are competing through a robotic system called Artec.
Starting from July, we started to prepare for the competition. 
We came up with several different strategies, built different robots, and wrote programs for each of them. 
The process took a lot of time and trials, and many turned out to not work.
But in the end, we still managed to win the first place in the competition.
